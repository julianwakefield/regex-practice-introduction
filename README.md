# Regular Expressions

A regular expression, or regex, is a search pattern
for finding or replacing characters in a string. Regex 
is not unique to Ruby, and understanding
how to read and write regular expressions can help
you accomplish many tasks with relative ease - imagine
you've spent days writing a long essay about Mark Twain, 
only to find out you've repeatedly written it Mark _Twin_.
Spellchecking won't help you since 'twin' is a valid
word. However, it would be possible to write a single
line of Ruby code that uses a regular expression to replace
_all_ instances of _Twin_ with _Twain_. Done.

Regular expressions follow a specific syntax that can
be complicated and sometimes difficult to understand. In
this section are lessons that cover the basics of Regex,
including:
